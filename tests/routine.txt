//-------------------------TESTING ROUTINE-------------------------//

Because our program is a computer game that generates nearly everything randomly, also, lot of things depend on users input. It makes it very hard to automate testing.
We also used random seed = 0 to make game constant.
So, Whenever we make a change to the game we repeat the following routine.

///Routine///


                 -Action-                                               -Expected outcome-

///Player Testing///
Since the game is random, there are infinite possible interactions that the player can do. With infinite possbile interactions come unforseen bugs. To discover these unforseen problems we made our friends test the game every day.
